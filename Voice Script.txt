SECTION 1 (INTRO):
------------
Hello and welcome!
I have assembled a team for you that will help you complete this map!

Now, have a look!

This is your team!
Refer to them as 'mappers'

Perform well on each section and obtain as many points as you can.
You can only complete the entire map if your total point amount is over 30.000 at the end.


SECTION 2:
------------
Ready for your first quest?

Shoot the enemy and try not to miss.
If you miss too many times you will end up with less points so you must do your best.
Good luck fellow player!


SECTION 3:
------------
What a relief! Did you enjoy your first quest?
Well, no worry. You will have to do something easier for this section.
Which is... to obtain a few items from the ground.

Easy right?
Good luck, fellow player!


SECTION 4:
------------
Hope you enjoyed yourself while collecting items!
Now it's time for something more fun...
Slashing it is! I hope your stamina is good heheh~.

Slash the black virus boxes to complete the quest.
Watch out at the end though!


SECTION 5:
------------
Whew... That was intense!
It's time for some aim based challenge now.
Hopefully your aim is good enough!

Popping balloons is fun, right?
Well, now it's your chance to pop as many as you can!


SECTION 6:
------------
That must've been fun.
The next quest is much easier though.

Just collect a few artifacts from the ground.
Should be easy!


SECTION 7:
------------
OK.
The next quest is very simple.
It's about lyrics...

Your Avatar will help you with this.
Be consistent and the lyrics will be delivered correctly on time.


SECTION 8:
------------
Alright.
Look, we are almost finished!

Next quest is even easier than the previous one.
Just keep an eye on the aircrafts evading from behind the building.


SECTION 9:
------------
Oh no!!
Two of the mappers are going to fight each other!
It will have a negative effect on your points!

Try to stop them before they drain all of your points!
The longer they fight... the more points you lose.

I'm counting on you!
I know you can make them stop!


AFTER ALL SECTIONS:
------------
